# HBB-Evolutionary-Study
Comparative analysis of HBB protein between Human and Chimpanzee using Biopython

This project compares the **beta-globin (HBB) protein** sequences of humans and chimpanzees.  
The coding sequence (CDS) was retrieved from NCBI, translated into protein, and analyzed for amino acid composition.
## Contents
- `Project_report_HBB_Human_vs_Chimp.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with all steps (sequence retrieval, processing, analysis, and graphs).
- `Human_HBB_amino_acid_counts.csv` → Amino acid composition for human HBB.  
- `Chimpanzee_HBB_amino_acid_counts.csv` → Amino acid composition for chimpanzee HBB.
- `HBB_aa_comparison.csv` → composition compare using DataFrame
- `HBB_Human_vs_Chimpanzee_amino_acid_comparison(side_by_side).png` → Comparison bar chart.
## Key Findings
- Human and chimpanzee HBB proteins show **nearly identical amino acid compositions**.  
- The side-by-side bar chart highlights the strong **evolutionary conservation** of this gene.
